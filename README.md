# Program-that-generates-only-odd-numbers-from-a-parallel-in-LINQ


I created thiws secific program to be able to offer a method which would generate odd numbers in parallel using the LINQ fucntion once again. The LINQ function is fun to work with and I'm havining test out small snippets which will acutate fucntons thst i wan to command in this little environemtn that will make  a big impact or offer a specific feature in this are. 

The program here itself povides a set of methods for querying objects that implement ParallelQuery{TSource} to generate odd numbers in parallel. Using the Where condition checks the modulus of the value of ‘x’ variable by 2 is not equal to 0. 


From the standpoint,
I would want to Then select statement "is used" to check the value ‘i’ variable is greater than or equal to the value of ‘i’ variable. You can imoplement this by changing the variable in  a more modified way if deemed neccisary, 

from thsi point I made it simple to autmate the  use of the  "foreach" statement , which will go ahead and print the odd numbers.
